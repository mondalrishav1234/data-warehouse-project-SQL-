Quality Checks
===============================================================================
Script Purpose:
    This script performs quality checks to verify the integrity, consistency,
    and accuracy of the Gold Layer. These checks cover:
    - Ensuring surrogate keys are unique within dimension tables.
    - Verifying referential integrity between fact and dimension tables.
    - Validating relationships within the data model for reliable analytics.

Usage Notes:
    - Review and investigate any discrepancies identified during the checks.
    - Resolve identified issues to maintain the reliability and accuracy of
      the Gold Layer.
